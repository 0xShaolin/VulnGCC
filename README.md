# VulnGCC
Another quick script you can use to compile vulnerable executables for Binary Exploitation.
## Prerequisites
All you need is gcc. If for some reason you don't have it (makes no sense to be fair), here is how:
```bash
apt install gcc
```
## Installation
It is quite simple. Simply copy paste the following code block:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xShaolin/VulnGCC /tmp/VulnGCC
sudo mv /tmp/VulnGCC/vulngcc /usr/bin/vulngcc
rm -rf /tmp/VulnGCC
```

## Anything else?
Just use the issues tab with recommendations for projects and/or how to improve this one.
